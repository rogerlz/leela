Description: Leela frontend server
 Leela is a property-graph engine that allows storing properties as
 time-series, besides the usual key-value properties.
 .
 The graph engine is fairly simple and not intended to substitute real
 graph databases but to describe the relationship of the structure you
 are monitoring, such as a datacenter.
 .
 This package is the frontend the user usually connects to using a zmq.
